                Mixed martial arts (MMA) sometimes referred to as cage fighting, is a full-contact combat sport based
                on striking,
                grappling and ground fighting, made up from various combat sports and martial arts from around the
                world. The first
                documented use of the term mixed martial arts was in a review of UFC 1 by television critic Howard
                Rosenberg in 1993.
                The question of who actually coined the term is subject to debate.
            </p>
            <p>During the early 20th century, various interstylistic contests took place throughout Japan and in the
                countries of the
                Four Asian Tigers. In Brazil, there was the sport of Vale Tudo, in which fighters from various styles
                fought with little
                to no rules. The Gracie family was known to promote Vale Tudo matches as a way to promote their own
                Brazilian jiu-jitsu
                style. An early high-profile mixed martial arts bout was fought in 1951, between the judoka Masahiko
                Kimura and
                Brazilian jiu-jitsu founder Hélio Gracie in Brazil. In the West, the concept of combining elements of
                multiple martial
                arts was popularized by Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do during the late 1960s to early 1970s. A precursor to
                modern MMA was the
                1976 Muhammad Ali vs. Antonio Inoki bout, fought between boxer Muhammad Ali and wrestler Antonio Inoki
                in Japan, where
                it later inspired the foundation of Pancrase in 1993 and Pride Fighting Championships in 1997.
                <br>
                In 1980, CV Productions, Inc. created the first regulated MMA league in the United States, called Tough
                Guy Contest,
                which was later renamed Battle of the Superfighters. The company sanctioned ten tournaments in
                Pennsylvania. However, in
                1983 the Pennsylvania State Senate passed a bill prohibiting the sport. In 1993, the Gracie family
                brought
                Brazilian jiu-jitsu, developed in Brazil from the 1920s, to the United States by founding the Ultimate
                Fighting
                Championship (UFC) MMA promotion company. The company held an event with almost no rules, mostly due to
                the influence of
                Art Davie and Rorion Gracie attempting to replicate Vale Tudo fights that existed in Brazil and would
                later implement
                a different set of rules (example: eliminating kicking a grounded opponent), which differed from other
                leagues which
                were more in favour of realistic fights.
                <br><br>
                Originally promoted as a competition to find the most effective martial arts for real unarmed combat,
                competitors from
                different fighting styles were pitted against one another in contests with relatively few rules.
                Later, individual
                fighters incorporated multiple martial arts into their style. MMA promoters were pressured to adopt
                additional rules to
                increase competitors' safety, to comply with sport regulations and to broaden mainstream acceptance of
                the sport.
                Following these changes, the sport has seen increased popularity with a pay-per-view business that
                rivals boxing and
                professional wrestling.

                In Ancient China, combat sport appeared in the form of Leitai, a no-holds-barred mixed combat sport that
                combined Chinese
                martial arts, boxing and wrestling.
                The Pancrastinae: A statue portraying the pancratium, an event which took place in the Roman Colosseum.
                Even as late as
                the Early Middle Ages, statues were put up in Rome and other cities to honor remarkable pankratiasts.
                This statue, now
                part of the Uffizi collection, is a Roman copy of a lost Greek original, circa 3rd century BC.

                A scene of Ancient Greek pankratiasts fighting. Originally found on a Panathenaic amphora, Lamberg
                Collection.
                In Ancient Greece, there was a sport called pankration, which featured grappling and striking skills
                similar to those
                found in modern MMA. Pankration was formed by combining the already established wrestling and boxing
                traditions and, in
                Olympic terms, first featured in the 33rd Olympiad in 648 BC. All strikes and holds were allowed with
                the exception of
                biting and gouging, which were banned. The fighters, called pankratiasts, fought until someone could not
                continue or
                signaled submission by raising their index finger; there were no rounds. According to the
                historian E. Norman
                Gardiner, "No branch of athletics was more popular than the pankration." There is also evidence of
                similar mixed
                combat sports in Ancient Egypt, India and Japan.</p>
