                UFC 253 is in the backpack and we are heading for 254 with lightningspeed. This should be
                and
                probably will
                be a fight for the ages. Two true martial artist who fear no other man alive will go head to head inside
                the
                octagon....
                The UFC 254 main card has been revealed and it will look slightly different than what fans are
                accustomed to
                seeing. Headlined by the highly anticipated matchup for the undisputed lightweight title between Khabib
                Nurmagomedov
                and interim
                champ Justin Gaethje, the PPV card will feature six matchups, opposed to the usual five. UFC 254 will
                take
                place Oct. 24
                to cap off a five-week trip to Abu Dhabi for the promotion.... </p>
            <p>The question Justin Gaethje hopes to answer on October 24, in the UFC 254 main event, is that same
                question that over
                two dozen fighters before him have failed at: how to overcome the puzzle that is Khabib Nurmagomedov.

                Whatever the Dagestani fighter’s kryptonite may be, it has yet to be discovered by any of his past 28
                opponents. That
                28-0 mark is a daunting one, the best in the promotion by far. Gaethje (22-2), the UFC’s interim
                lightweight champ,
                recognizes that Nurmagomedov has “fought a lot of different guys.” But a few things set “The Highlight”
                apart.
                <br>
                “My confidence is probably my biggest factor right now, paired with the power that I possess, paired
                with the coach that
                I have,” Gaethje explained at a UFC 254 media day on Thursday. “That’s a dangerous combination. And I
                don’t care if I
                win or lose. At the end of the day, as long as I make my family happy, as long as I’m proud of my
                performance, than it
                doesn’t matter. That’s what makes me most dangerous.”

                There’s that, and his wrestling background. Gaethje is a folkstyle wrestler, and he’s used that to shore
                up his defense.
                “I never had a great offense, but you could not take me down, and you could not hold me down,” he said
                of his time on
                the mats.
                <br><br>
                “It’s very important to stay off the ground. I’m not trying to go in there and wrestle with Khabib. I
                don’t think I
                could beat him in a wrestling match, because I haven’t focused on wrestling like that, to win a
                wrestling match,”
                Gaethje admitted. “I’m not there. But I’ve constantly worked on my defense. That’s never gone away.”

                If he Khabib manages to put him on the mat, “I need to make him work like his life depends on it. If he
                does take me
                down, then I need to make sure that I threaten him with something that will at least make him hesitate
                the next time,”
                Gaethje added.

            <p>
                It’s a mindset that has taken him through eight weeks of camp, with three and change left to go. Perhaps
                it will help
                him put a dent in Nurmagomedov’s perfect record.

                While Gaethje is always one to focus on the task at hand (ask him, and he’ll no doubt tell you that the
                world ends on
                October 24, because he refuses to look past his fights), there was one topic that got him talking.
                Outside of UFC 254,
                that is.

                “I’ve never met someone as fake as Colby Covington,” added Gaethje. “As a man, I would love to slap him
                right across the
                face.”

                24 on Yas
                Island in Abu Dhabi.</p>
